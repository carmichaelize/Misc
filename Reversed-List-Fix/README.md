Reversed Ordered List Fixer
=================
This is was just a quick experiment I made with jQuery to see if I could get the HTML5 'reversed' attribute working on ol's in non webkit browsers.

It works by applying the correct value to each list item using the 'value' attribute which is supported cross browser. You can also provide a start value and it will use that as a starting point if you want.
